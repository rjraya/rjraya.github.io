Welcome to Rodrigo Raya's personal webpage. \n

I am a researcher in computer science with special interest in formal reasoning as found in interactive and automated theorem provers. \n

My current research interests lie in the automation of proofs about distributed systems ("broadly construed"). \n

I wholeheartedly recommend Cajal's "Advice for a Young Investigator". \n
