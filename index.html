<p style="line-height: 2;">
Welcome to Rodrigo Raya's personal webpage. <br>

I am a researcher in computer science with special interest in formal reasoning as found in interactive and automated theorem provers. <br>

My current research interests lie in the automation of proofs about distributed systems (broadly construed). <br>

I wholeheartedly recommend Cajal's "Advice for a Young Investigator". <br>
