Welcome to Rodrigo Raya's personal webpage. <br>

I am a researcher in computer science with special interest in formal reasoning as found in interactive and automated theorem provers. <br>

My current research interests lie in the automation of proofs about distributed systems (broadly construed). <br>

You can find my research works on <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/257/8380.html">dblp</a>. <br>

You may contact me at r.rayacastellano at gmail dot com.
